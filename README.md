# DMS API (Distribution Management System)

The DMS API (Distribution Management System) is a comprehensive solution specifically designed for managing the distribution of medical products. It provides a robust platform for efficiently handling various aspects of distribution, including user profiles, company management, inventory tracking, and customer management.

## Features

- **User Profiles:** Each user within the system has their own profile, allowing for personalized access and management.
  
- **Company Management:** Companies involved in the distribution process can be managed seamlessly within the system, including details about products they offer.

- **Employee Management:** The distribution system facilitates the management of employees associated with each distribution, ensuring smooth operations.
